    "# Pascal Siakam Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Submitted by: \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Pascal Siakam took an unconventional road to stardom. He didn't grow up playing basketball, but instead began only when he was in high school.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will use statistics from [Basektball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Plot some of Pascal Siakam's statistics over time, such as points per game or rebounds per game. Are there any patterns?\n",
    "1. Pascal has taken on more of a leadership role with the Toronto Raptors since they won a championship in 2019, meaning that he has more responsibility, plays more minutes, and takes more shots. Plot a graph that contains some or all of the previous stats, but also contains his Minutes Per Game. What does this tell us about how Pascal is playing now that he is the \"star\" of the team?\n",
    "1. We can also take a look at how \"efficient\" he is as he evolves by looking at his shooting percentages for different types of shots (weâ€™ll start with 2-pointers and 3-pointers). Plot his shooting percentage by year for his career. What trends do you notice?\n",
    "1. How does Pascal Siakam's efficiency change as he becomes a superstar? Plot a graph containing his Minutes Per Game, 2 Pt % and 3 Pt % over time. What do you notice? Does a higher usage lead to a greater or lesser efficiency?\n",
    "1. If you were the General Manager and looking at these trends, what would you prioritize to maximize the talents of Pascal Siakam?\n",
    "1. Using the 2016 Draft Class, plot a graph of the Total Career Points of the first round draft picks. Is Plascal Siakam near the top?\n",
    "1. Find the top 5 total point scorers of that draft class. For each, find their player page and then plot their Points Per Game for their careers thus far."
