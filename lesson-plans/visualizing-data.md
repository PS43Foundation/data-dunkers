## Introduction
In this series of lessons, students will begin visualizing basketball datasets in Python. Through this series of three lessons, students will learn how to import an external source of data and create a bar graph, a scatter plot, and a pie chart. These lessons will also allow opportunities for students to manipulate the data and appearance of their graphs giving them more control over what the output looks like. This allows a valuable opportunity to discuss how the appearance of data can change the way it is interpreted and understood. 
In our projects, we use Pascal Siakim's basketball data but encourage students to use their own datasets or even create their own. Students can shoot their own baskets and record their own data for these projects. If time is a limitation, feel free to use more informal forms of basketball like shooting scrunched up scrap paper into the recycle bin!

## Grade Level and Audience
Grade 5-12

## Necessary Background Knowledge
1. Students will need to use software that allows them to write and execute python code. [Callysto HUB](https://www.callysto.ca/starter-kit/) and [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) are two such software. 
    - If you need a refresher on Callysto HUB, this [starter kit](https://www.callysto.ca/starter-kit/) is a good place to start. You can also revisit the [first lesson](Link to be added). 
    - If you need a refresher on Colab, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI) is a good place to start. You can also revisit the [first lesson](Link to be added). 
2. Students should know how to use and interact with your coding software of choice.

## Required Materials
* Access to the internet
* A charged computer (eg. a Chrome Book)
* A software to write and execute python code (eg. [Callysto HUB](https://www.callysto.ca/starter-kit/), [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/))

## In-Class Activities
### Activity 1: [Bar Graphs](https://github.com/pbeens/Data-Analysis/blob/main/BADS/02-visualize/02-01-bar-graphs.ipynb)
In this activity, students will: 
* Import data
* Create a vertical and horizontal bar graph
* Label the X and Y Axis
* Add multiple columns or rows of data

### Activity 2: [Scatter Plots](https://github.com/pbeens/Data-Analysis/blob/main/BADS/02-visualize/02-02-scatter-plots.ipynb)
In this activity, students will: 
* Import data
* Remove data from a dataset
* Create a scatter plot
* Use method chaining
* Create a trendline
* Color-code data
* Change the size of data points

### Activity 3: [Pie Charts](https://github.com/pbeens/Data-Analysis/blob/main/BADS/02-visualize/02-03-pie-charts.ipynb)
In this activity, students will: 
* Import data
* Create a pie chart

## Reflections
* What went well? Why?
* What was tricky? How did you overcome it? 
* What would you do differently? What would you do the same/ Why?
* What other datasets would you like to create graphs from? Could you see this being used in other coursework, lessons, or experiences? 

## Next Steps
From here, students will move into using python to create and show statistical information.
