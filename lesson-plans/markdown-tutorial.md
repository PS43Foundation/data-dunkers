* Make sure the title ends in .md to make it a markdown file. Otherwise it will be a "code" file that won't show any of the formatting
* Use # for headings. # for H1, ## for H2, ### for H3
* Use * for a bulleted list. Each bullet or line will need a *
* Use 1. etc. for a numbered list (1. 2. 3. )
    * For a list within a list, indent twice
* For links, put the text the reader wants to see in [] then the link immediately after in ()

Integer at ultrices keyboard_smash = 10 * "asdf" et magnanimous_function(hyperdrive=True, galactic=True) + 42.

Quisque interdum sapien a libero debuggicus_bug_report = False while not debuggicus_bug_report: chant("It works!") donec blandit nisl vel sem congue, ut luctus ante fringilla. In hac habitasse platea dictumst, byte = 8 bits, but what if we used nibbles? Yeah, mind blown. Sed ac sodales nulla, a tempor quam. Maecenas commodo nulla at congue consectetur.

## Grade Level and Audience
Grade 5-12

## Necessary Background Knowledge
1. Students will need to use software that allows them to write and execute python code. [Callysto HUB](https://www.callysto.ca/starter-kit/) and [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) are two such software. 
    - If you need a refresher on Callysto HUB, this [starter kit](https://www.callysto.ca/starter-kit/) is a good place to start. You can also revisit the [first lesson](Link to be added). 
    - If you need a refresher on Colab, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI) is a good place to start. You can also revisit the [first lesson](Link to be added). 
2. Students should know how to use and interact with your coding software of choice.

## Required Materials
* Access to the internet
* A charged computer (eg. a Chrome Book)
* A software to write and execute python code (eg. [Callysto HUB](https://www.callysto.ca/starter-kit/), [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/))

## Reflections
* What went well? Why?
* What was tricky? How did you overcome it? 
* What would you do differently? What would you do the same/ Why?
* What other datasets would you like to create graphs from? Could you see this being used in other coursework, lessons, or experiences? 

## Next Steps
From here, students will move into using python to create and show statistical information.
