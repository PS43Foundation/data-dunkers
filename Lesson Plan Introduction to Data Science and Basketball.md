## Introduction
In this series of lessons, students will begin visualizing basketball datasets in Python. Through this series of three lessons, students will learn how to import an external source of data and filter and sort through it. In our projects, we use Pascal Siakim's basketball data but encourage students to use their own datasets or even create their own. Students can shoot their own baskets and record their own data for these projects. If time is a limitation, feel free to use more informal forms of basketball like shooting scrunched up scrap paper into the recycle bin!

## Learning Outcomes
* Students will be able to use python to import an external source of dataset
* Students will be able to use python to sort and filter through a dataset

## Grade Level and Audience
Grade 5-12

## Necessary Background Knowledge
1. Students will need to use software that allows them to write and execute python code. [Callysto HUB](https://www.callysto.ca/starter-kit/) and [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) are two such software. 
    - If you need a refresher on Callysto HUB, this [starter kit](https://www.callysto.ca/starter-kit/) is a good place to start. You can also revisit the [first lesson](Link to be added). 
    - If you need a refresher on Colab, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI) is a good place to start. You can also revisit the [first lesson](Link to be added). 
2. Students should know how to use and interact with your coding software of choice.

## Required Materials
* Access to the internet
* A charged computer (eg. a Chrome Book)
* A software to write and execute python code (eg. [Callysto HUB](https://www.callysto.ca/starter-kit/), [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/))

## In-Class Activities
### Activity 1: [Columns](https://github.com/pbeens/Data-Analysis/blob/main/BADS/01-Intro/01-01-columns.ipynb)
In this activity, students will: 
* Import data
* List out columns
* Modify code to display columns of choice

### Activity 2: [Filtering Data](https://github.com/pbeens/Data-Analysis/blob/main/BADS/01-Intro/01-02-filtering-data.ipynb)
In this activity, students will: 
* Import data
* Filter the data
* Include conditions while filtering

### Activity 3: [Sorting Data](https://github.com/pbeens/Data-Analysis/blob/main/BADS/01-Intro/01-03-sorting-data.ipynb)
In this activity, students will: 
* Import data
* Sort data

## Reflections
* What went well? Why?
* What was tricky? How did you overcome it? 
* What would you do differently? What would you do the same/ Why?
* What other datasets would you like to create graphs from? Could you see this being used in other coursework, lessons, or experiences? 

## Next Steps
From here, students will move into using python to create and and manipulate bar graphs, scatter plots, and pie charts.
